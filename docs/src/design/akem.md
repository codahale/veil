# Key Encapsulation

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is as follows, given the sender's key pair, $d_S$ and $Q_S$, an ephemeral key pair, $d_E$ and $Q_E$, the
receiver's public key, $Q_R$, a plaintext message $P$, and MAC size $N_M$:

```text
INIT('veil.akem', level=128)
AD(LE_U32(N_M),   meta=true)
AD(Q_R)
AD(Q_S)
```

A [`veil.dvsig`](dvsig.md) signature $S$ is calculated of the ephemeral public key $Q_E$ using the recipient's public
key as the designated verifier.

The static shared secret point is calculated ${ZZ_S}=[{d_S}]{Q_R}=[{d_R}{d_S}]G$ and used as a key to encrypt the
ephemeral public key $Q_E$ and signature $S$:

```text
KEY(ZZ_S)
SEND_ENC(Q_E) -> E_1
SEND_ENC(S)   -> E_2
```

The ephemeral shared secret point is calculated ${ZZ_E}=[{d_E}]{Q_R}=[{d_R}{d_E}]G$ and used as a key:

```text
KEY(ZZ_E)
```

This is effectively an authenticated ECDH KEM, but instead of returning KDF output for use in a DEM, we use the keyed
protocol to directly encrypt the ciphertext and create a MAC:

```text
SEND_ENC(P)     -> C
SEND_MAC(N_M)   -> M
```

The resulting ciphertext is the concatenation of $E_1$, $E_2$, $C$, and $M$.

## Decapsulation

Decapsulation is then the inverse of encryption, given the recipient's key pair, $d_R$ and $Q_R$, and the sender's
public key $Q_S$:

```text
INIT('veil.akem', level=128)
AD(LE_U32(N_M),   meta=true)
AD(Q_R)
AD(Q_S)
```

The static shared secret point is calculated ${ZZ_S}=[{d_R}]{Q_S}=[{d_R}{d_S}]G$ and used as a key to decrypt the
ephemeral public key $Q_E$ and signature $S$:

```text
KEY(ZZ_S)
RECV_ENC(E_1) -> Q_E
RECV_ENC(E_2) -> S
```

The signature $S$ is verified with [`veil.dvsig`](dvsig.md). If invalid, the decryption returns an error.

The ephemeral shared secret point is calculated ${ZZ_E}=[{d_R}]{Q_E}=[{d_R}{d_E}]G$ and used as a key to decrypt the
plaintext and verify the MAC:

```text
KEY(ZZ_E)
RECV_ENC(C) -> P
RECV_MAC(M)
```

If the `RECV_MAC` call is successful, the ephemeral public key $Q_E$ and the plaintext message $P$ are returned.

## IND-CCA2 Security

This construction combines two overlapping KEM/DEM constructions: a "El Gamal-like" KEM combined with a STROBE-based
AEAD, and an ephemeral ECIES-style KEM combined with a STROBE-based AEAD.

The STROBE-based AEAD is equivalent to Construction 5.6 of Modern Cryptography 3e and is CCA-secure per Theorem 5.7,
provided STROBE's encryption is CPA-secure. STROBE's SEND_ENC is equivalent to Construction 3.31 and is CPA-secure per
Theorem 3.29, provided STROBE is a sufficiently strong pseudorandom function.

The first KEM/DEM construction is equivalent to Construction 12.19 of Modern Cryptography 3e, and is CCA-secure per
Theorem 12.22, provided the gap-CDH problem is hard relative to ristretto255 and STROBE is modeled as a random oracle.

The second KEM/DEM construction is equivalent to Construction 12.23 of Modern Cryptography 3e, and is CCA-secure per
Corollary 12.24, again provided that the gap-CDH problem is hard relative to ristretto255 and STROBE is modeled as a
random oracle.

## IK-CCA Security

`veil.akem` is IK-CCA (per [Bellare][ik-cca]), in that it is impossible for an attacker in possession of two public keys
to determine which of the two keys a given ciphertext was encrypted with in either chosen-plaintext or chosen-ciphertext
attacks. Informally, veil.akem ciphertexts consist exclusively of STROBE ciphertext and PRF output; an attacker being
able to distinguish between ciphertexts based on keying material would imply STROBE's AEAD construction is not IND-CCA2.

Consequently, a passive adversary scanning for encoded points would first need the parties' static Diffie-Hellman secret
in order to distinguish messages from random noise.

## Forward Sender Security

Because the ephemeral private key is discarded after encryption, a compromise of the sender's private key will not
compromise previously-created ciphertexts. If the sender's private key is compromised, the most an attacker can discover
about previously sent messages is the ephemeral public key, not the message itself.

## Insider Authenticity

This construction is not secure against insider attacks on authenticity, nor is it intended to be. A recipient can forge
ciphertexts which appear to be from a sender by re-using the ephemeral public key and encrypting an alternate plaintext,
but the forgeries will only be decryptable by the forger. Because this type of forgery is possible, `veil.akem`
ciphertexts are therefore repudiable.

## Randomness Re-Use

The ephemeral key pair, $d_E$ and $Q_E$, are generated outside of this construction and can be used multiple times for
multiple recipients. This improves the efficiency of the scheme without reducing its security, per Bellare et al.'s
treatment of [Randomness Reusing Multi-Recipient Encryption Schemes][rr-mres].

## Key Compromise Impersonation

Per [Strangio][kci]:

> \[S\]uppose an adversary (say Eve) has learned the private key of Alice either by compromising the machine running an

> (KCI)...

A static Diffie-Hellman exchange is vulnerable to KCI attacks, in that the shared secret point ${ZZ_S}$ can be 
calculated as $[{d_S}]{Q_R}$ by an authentic sender or as $[{d_R}]{Q_S}$ by an attacker in possession of the recipient's
private key $d_S$ and the sender's public key $Q_S$.

`veil.akem` prevents KCI attacks by including a [designated-verifier signature](dvsig.md) of the ephemeral public key.
The signature can be verified by but not constructed by the recipient; as such, a verified signature proves the 
ephemeral public key is authentic. Because the signature cannot be verified without the recipient's private key, a
dishonest recipient cannot prove to a third party that the ephemeral public key was provided by the sender without
revealing their own private key.

## Delegatability

`veil.dvsig` is [delegatable][delegatability], which means the delegated form of the signature can be created by someone
other than the signer. If the signer provides a third party with $s$ and $r$, anyone in possession of the signer and
verifier's public keys can calculate $U$ and $K$.

Non-delegatability is critical when designing protocols to constrain potentially dishonest signers, but in this context
`veil.dvsig` is used exclusively to provide deniable authentication of ephemeral public keys in `veil.akem`. The 
signatures are encrypted using the static Diffie-Hellman shared secret point $ZZ_S$, so a sender attempting to delegate
verifier designation would either have to reveal their private key to the delegate or encrypt the designated signature
themselves.
